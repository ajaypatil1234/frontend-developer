        to every langauge there a two type of function.

        (1) pre-define/built-in

        for ex,  write(), writeln(), getelementBYID()

        (2)user-define

        advantage of function -> reduce time    
        not needed  to re-write a code .

        syntax :
        function function_name() {
        statement
        }
    
        Event?

        to perform task.

        Event handler?
             to handler an event.
